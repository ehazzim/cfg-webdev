CFG Web Development Project

This project involves creating a web-based application that allows users to search for and book travel accommodations, such as hotels and flights using a variety of programming languages and technologies, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end (with wider potential if implementing back-end languages like Python or Node.js). The application would allow users to search for travel options based on different criteria, such as destination, dates, and budget, and would allow them to view detailed information about the accommodations and make bookings. Additionally, it could potentially integrate with other travel-related APIs to provide additional functionality, such as maps and weather forecasts for destinations.
